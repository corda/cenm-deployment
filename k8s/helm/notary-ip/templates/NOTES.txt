    kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc -w {{ include "notary-ip.fullname" . }}

You can later get public IP address again by running this command:

    kubectl get svc --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "notary-ip.fullname" . }} --template "{{"{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}"}}"
